## Wallet Setup

### Choosing a Wallet

Etrid offers three wallet options:

| Wallet Type | Best For | Features | Download |
|-------------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Web Wallet** | Quick access, beginners | No installation, works on any device | [wallet.etrid.org](https://wallet.etrid.org) |
| **Browser Extension** | Daily users, DApp interaction | Polkadot.js compatible, secure | [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore) |
| **Mobile Wallet** | On-the-go transactions | iOS/Android, QR code scanning | App Store / Google Play |

**Recommendation for beginners:** Start with the **Web Wallet** for easiest setup.

### Creating Your First Account (Web Wallet)

#### Step 1: Access the Web Wallet

1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to **[wallet.etrid.org](https://wallet.etrid.org)**
3. Verify the URL is correct (check for HTTPS and correct spelling)
4. Click **"Launch Wallet"**

**Security Tip:** Bookmark the official URL to avoid phishing sites.

#### Step 2: Create a New Account

1. Click **"Create Account"** in the top right corner
2. You'll see a **12-word recovery phrase** displayed

**Example (DO NOT use this phrase):**
```
witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least
```

#### Step 3: Save Your Recovery Phrase

**⚠️ CRITICAL: This is the most important step!**

Your recovery phrase is the ONLY way to restore your account if:
- You lose access to your device
- Your browser cache is cleared
- You want to access your account on another device

**How to save it safely:**

1. **Write it down on paper** in the exact order shown (1-12)
2. **Double-check** each word for accuracy
3. **Store it securely** in a safe, fireproof location
4. **Make a backup copy** and store it separately
5. **NEVER** take a screenshot or save digitally
6. **NEVER** share it with anyone (not even Etrid support)

**Who controls the recovery phrase controls the funds. There is NO password reset!**

#### Step 4: Verify and Continue

1. Check the box: **"I have saved my recovery phrase safely"**
2. Click **"Continue"**
3. You may be asked to verify by selecting words in order

#### Step 5: Set a Password

1. Create a strong password (minimum 8 characters)
2. Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
3. Confirm your password

**Good password example:** `M0on$Rocket!2025`
**Bad password example:** `password123`

**Note:** This password encrypts your account on THIS device only. You'll still need your recovery phrase to restore on other devices.

#### Step 6: Name Your Account

1. Give your account a memorable name (e.g., "My Main Account")
2. Click **"Create Account"**

**Success!** You now have an Etrid account with an address like:
```
5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY
```

### Understanding Your Account

**Your Etrid Address:**
- Starts with "5" (for Primearc Core Chain accounts)
- 48 characters long
- This is your PUBLIC identifier - safe to share
- Think of it like your email address or bank account number

**Your Recovery Phrase:**
- 12 words in a specific order
- This is your PRIVATE key - never share
- Think of it like your password or PIN

**Account Address vs. Recovery Phrase:**

| Account Address | Recovery Phrase |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| ✅ Share to receive funds | ❌ NEVER share |
| ✅ Post publicly | ❌ Keep completely private |
| ✅ Use on exchanges/forms | ❌ Store offline only |

### Creating Additional Accounts

You can create multiple accounts for different purposes:

1. Click the account dropdown (top right)
2. Click **"+ Add Account"**
3. Follow the same creation process

**Common account setups:**
- **Main Account:** Long-term holdings, staking
- **Trading Account:** Buying/selling, exchanges
- **DApp Account:** Interacting with decentralized apps
- **Savings Account:** Cold storage, rarely accessed

---

## Account Security

### The Golden Rules of Account Security

1. **NEVER share your recovery phrase** with anyone
2. **NEVER enter your recovery phrase** on websites (except official wallet restoration)
3. **ALWAYS verify URLs** before entering sensitive information
4. **ALWAYS use strong passwords**
5. **CONSIDER hardware wallets** for large amounts

### Recovery Phrase Security Best Practices

#### ✅ DO:

- Write recovery phrase on paper with pen/pencil
- Store in a fireproof safe or safety deposit box
- Make multiple copies stored in different locations
- Use metal backup solutions (fire/water resistant)
- Tell a trusted person WHERE it's stored (not the phrase itself)
- Consider using Shamir's Secret Sharing for high-value accounts

#### ❌ DON'T:

- Take screenshots or photos
- Store in cloud services (Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud)
- Send via email, text, or messaging apps
- Store in password managers (debatable - if you do, encrypt separately)
- Write it on devices connected to internet
- Laminate paper (prevents emergency destruction if compromised)

### Password Security

**For your wallet password:**

1. **Use a password manager** (1Password, Bitwarden, KeePass)
2. **Enable 2FA** on your password manager
3. **Use unique passwords** for each account
4. **Make passwords long** (12+ characters better than complex 8-character)

**Good password patterns:**
- Passphrase: `CorrectHorseBatteryStaple` (easy to remember, hard to crack)
- Random: `xK9#mP2$vL8@nQ5!` (use password manager to generate)

### Recognizing Phishing Attempts

**Common phishing tactics:**

1. **Fake wallet websites** with similar URLs:
   - ❌ `wallet-etrid.org` (dash instead of dot)
   - ❌ `etrid-wallet.com` (wrong domain)
   - ✅ `wallet.etrid.org` (correct official URL)

2. **Recovery phrase requests:**
   - ❌ "Support" asking for your recovery phrase
   - ❌ Emails asking you to "verify" your phrase
   - ❌ Pop-ups requesting recovery phrase entry

3. **Urgent messages:**
   - "Your account will be closed unless you act now"
   - "Verify your wallet within 24 hours"
   - "Claim your airdrop by entering your recovery phrase"

**When in doubt:**
- Check official Etrid social media channels
- Ask in official Discord/Telegram
- Visit official website directly (don't click email links)

### Social Engineering Protection

**Common social engineering attacks:**

1. **Impersonation:**
   - Fake "Etrid Support" on Discord/Telegram
   - DMs offering help with "account issues"
   - Lookalike social media accounts

2. **Too good to be true:**
   - "Send 1 ETR, get 2 ETR back" scams
   - Fake airdrops requiring private key entry
   - Guaranteed returns promises

3. **Urgency tactics:**
   - "Limited time offer"
   - "Act now or lose access"
   - "Your account has been flagged"

**Protection:**
- Etrid support will NEVER DM you first
- Etrid will NEVER ask for your recovery phrase
- There are NO "giveaways" requiring private key entry

### Device Security

**Keep your devices secure:**

1. **Operating System:**
   - Keep OS updated with latest security patches
   - Use antivirus software on Windows
   - Enable firewall

2. **Browser:**
   - Keep browser updated
   - Use ad blockers to prevent malicious ads
   - Clear cache regularly
   - Use browser extensions cautiously

3. **Network:**
   - Avoid public Wi-Fi for wallet access
   - Use VPN when on untrusted networks
   - Enable router firewall

### Emergency Procedures

**If you suspect compromise:**

1. **Immediately transfer funds** to a new account
2. **Create new recovery phrase** (new account)
3. **Report the incident** to Etrid team
4. **Analyze what happened** to prevent future compromise

**If you lose your recovery phrase:**

Unfortunately, **there is NO way to recover your account** without the recovery phrase. Your funds will be permanently inaccessible. This is why backup is critical.

**If you lose your password (but have recovery phrase):**

1. Click **"Restore Account"** in wallet
2. Enter your 12-word recovery phrase
3. Set a new password
4. Your account is restored with all funds intact

Status: Pending (0/3 confirmations)

[ View in Explorer ]  [ Close ]
```

#### Step 5: Track Confirmation

Watch the status update:
- **Pending:** 0/3 confirmations (in mempool)
- **Confirming:** 1/3, 2/3 confirmations (in blocks)
- **Finalized:** 3/3 confirmations (irreversible)

**Timeline:**
- 0-5 seconds: Pending
- 5-10 seconds: 1st confirmation
- 10-15 seconds: 2nd confirmation
- 15-20 seconds: Final confirmation

### Understanding Transaction Fees

**Fee calculation factors:**
1. **Transaction size** (bytes of data)
2. **Network congestion** (higher demand = higher fees)
3. **Priority** (optional: pay more for faster processing)

**Typical fees on Etrid:**
- Simple transfer: 0.0001 - 0.001 ETR (~$0.001 - $0.01)
- Complex transaction (smart contract): 0.001 - 0.01 ETR
- During high congestion: 0.01 - 0.1 ETR

**Fee optimization:**
- Transact during off-peak hours for lower fees
- Batch multiple transactions when possible
- Use Lightning-Bloc for micro-payments (minimal fees)

### Transaction History

**View all your transactions:**

1. Click **"Transactions"** tab in wallet
2. See complete history with:
   - Date/time
   - Type (sent/received)
   - Amount
   - Status (pending/finalized)
   - Transaction hash

**Filter options:**
- By date range
- By type (sent/received/all)
- By status
- By chain

**Export options:**

## Staking and Earning Rewards

### What is Staking?

**Staking** means locking your ETR tokens to support the network and earn rewards.

**Benefits:**
- **Earn passive income:** 8-15% annual rewards (APY varies)
- **Secure the network:** Help validate transactions
- **Governance voting power:** Staked tokens count for voting
- **Support decentralization:** Choose validators you trust

**How it works:**

```

**How to choose validators:**

**Look for:**
- ✅ Low commission (5% or less)
- ✅ High uptime (99%+)
- ✅ Verified identity
- ✅ Reasonable stake (not too high = centralization risk)
- ✅ Active community presence
- ✅ Regular updates and transparency

**Avoid:**
- ❌ 100% commission (you earn nothing)
- ❌ Very low uptime (<95%)
- ❌ Unknown validators with no identity
- ❌ Validators with excessive stake (over-concentration)

**Diversification strategy:**
- Select 8-16 validators (not just 1)
- Mix of large and small validators
- Different geographical locations
- Different operators (avoid same entity)

**Example selection:**
1. Etrid Foundation Node (0% commission, trusted)
2. Validator Alpha (5% commission, high uptime)
3. StakingRewards.com (3% commission, established)
4-16. Mix of community validators with good metrics

#### Step 3: Set Stake Amount

1. After selecting validators, click **"Next"**
2. Enter amount to stake:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Set Stake Amount                                 │

│                                                  │
│ Estimated Annual Rewards:                        │
│ 6.25 ETR (~12.5% APY)                           │
│                                                  │

│ [ Back ]                    [ Review ]          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**How much to stake:**
- Leave at least 1-5 ETR available for transaction fees
- Consider future transaction needs
- You can always stake more later
- Unstaking takes 28 days (plan accordingly)

**Example allocation:**
- Total balance: 90 ETR
- Stake: 50 ETR (earn rewards)
- Keep available: 40 ETR (for fees, transactions, flexibility)

### Understanding Rewards

**Reward calculation:**

```
Your Rewards = (Your Stake / Total Stake) × (Block Rewards + Fees) × (1 - Validator Commission)
```

**Factors affecting rewards:**
1. **Your stake amount:** More stake = more rewards
2. **Validator performance:** Uptime matters (offline = no rewards)
3. **Validator commission:** Lower commission = more for you
4. **Network participation:** Total staked affects reward rate
5. **Era points:** Validators with more era points earn more

**Reward distribution:**
- Paid every **era** (24 hours)
- Automatically added to your staked balance (compounding)
- Visible in "Pending Rewards" before distribution

**Example calculation:**

```
Your stake: 50 ETR
Total network stake: 10,000,000 ETR
Your share: 0.0005%

Era rewards pool: 1,000 ETR
Your validator's share: 50 ETR (5%)
Validator commission: 5%

Your rewards = 50 ETR × 0.0005% × 95% = 0.02375 ETR per era
Annual rewards ≈ 0.02375 × 365 = 8.66875 ETR
APY = 8.66875 / 50 = 17.3%
```

**Tax considerations:**
- Staking rewards may be taxable in your jurisdiction
- Keep records of rewards earned
- Consult tax professional for guidance
- Export transaction history for tax software

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: What is Etrid?**

A: Etrid is a multichain blockchain platform that connects 13 major blockchains, enabling cross-chain transactions, DeFi, and decentralized governance with 15-second finality.

**Q: How is Etrid different from other blockchains?**

A: Etrid offers unique features including 13 cross-chain bridges (PBCs), annual Consensus Day governance, Lightning-Bloc Layer 2 payments, and Ascending Scale of Finality consensus.

**Q: Is Etrid a fork of Polkadot?**

A: Etrid is built using Substrate (same framework as Polkadot) but is a completely independent network with unique consensus, governance, and multichain architecture.

**Q: What's the relationship between ETR and EDSC?**

A: ETR is the native token for staking, fees, and governance. EDSC is a USD-pegged stablecoin backed by reserves. Both exist on the Etrid blockchain.

### Account & Security

**Q: I lost my recovery phrase. Can I recover my account?**

A: Unfortunately, no. Without the recovery phrase, your account cannot be recovered. This is a fundamental security feature - no one can reset or recover it for you.

**Q: Can I change my recovery phrase?**

A: No. The recovery phrase is cryptographically derived from your account. To change it, you must create a new account and transfer funds.

**Q: Is my password the same as my recovery phrase?**

A: No! Your password encrypts the account locally in your browser. Your recovery phrase is the master key that works on any device. Both are important but serve different purposes.

**Q: Someone knows my account address. Are my funds at risk?**

A: No. Your account address is public and safe to share. Only your recovery phrase can control funds.

### Transactions

**Q: How long do transactions take?**

A: Transactions appear in ~5 seconds and achieve finality in ~15 seconds (3 block confirmations).

**Q: Can I cancel a transaction?**

A: Once submitted, transactions cannot be canceled. They're either confirmed or rejected (if invalid). Always double-check before sending!

**Q: What happens if I send to the wrong address?**

A: Blockchain transactions are irreversible. Funds sent to the wrong address are lost unless you can contact the recipient and request a return.

**Q: Why is my transaction fee so high?**

A: Fees increase during network congestion. Typical fees are 0.0001-0.001 ETR. If fees seem excessive, try waiting for off-peak hours.

### Staking

**Q: What's the minimum amount to stake?**

A: You can nominate validators with as little as 1 ETR. To run your own validator, you need 64 ETR minimum (or 20,000 ETR for full validator).

**Q: How often are staking rewards paid?**

A: Rewards are distributed every era (24 hours) and automatically added to your staked balance (compounding).

**Q: Can I unstake anytime?**

A: You can initiate unstaking anytime, but there's a 28-day unbonding period before funds become available.

**Q: What happens if my validator goes offline?**

A: You won't earn rewards for the period they're offline. If they're slashed for misbehavior, you may lose a small portion of stake. This is why diversifying across multiple validators is important.

**Q: Do rewards compound automatically?**

A: Yes! By default, rewards are added to your staked balance and earn additional rewards (compound interest).

### Governance

**Q: How much voting power do I have?**

A: Your voting power equals your staked ETR. You can multiply this using conviction voting (lock tokens longer for more power).

**Q: When is Consensus Day?**

A: Consensus Day occurs annually on February 14th. It's a 24-hour voting period for major fiscal and governance decisions.

**Q: Do I have to vote?**

A: No, voting is optional. However, participating in governance helps shape the network's future and is encouraged.

**Q: Can I delegate my vote to someone else?**

A: Yes! You can delegate voting power to a representative you trust. This is useful if you don't have time to research every proposal.

### Cross-Chain

**Q: Which chains does Etrid support?**

A: Etrid supports 13 chains: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Polkadot, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, Cosmos, Algorand, Tezos, Near, and EDSC.

**Q: How long does bridging take?**

A: Bridge times vary by source chain. Ethereum bridges take ~15-30 minutes. Faster chains like Solana take ~5-10 minutes.

**Q: Are bridges safe?**

A: Etrid bridges use multi-signature custodians and light client verification for security. While no bridge is 100% risk-free, Etrid's architecture minimizes risks.

**Q: Can I bridge any token?**

A: Currently, you can bridge native tokens (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.) and major stablecoins. Support for additional tokens is being added.

### Technical

**Q: What consensus does Etrid use?**

A: Ascending Scale of Finality (ASF) - a novel mechanism that combines proof of stake with coinage tracking to prevent centralization.

**Q: How many transactions per second can Etrid handle?**

A: Primearc Core Chain handles ~1,000 TPS. With Lightning-Bloc Layer 2, throughput scales to ~100,000 TPS.

**Q: Is Etrid compatible with Ethereum?**

A: Etrid has a PBC for Ethereum bridging. Future updates may add EVM compatibility for running Ethereum smart contracts directly.

**Q: Can I run a node without being a validator?**

A: Yes! You can run a full node to sync the blockchain, query data, and submit transactions without staking or validating.

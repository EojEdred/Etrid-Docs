Dear Trail of Bits Team,

I am reaching out on behalf of **Ëtrid Protocol**, a decentralized multichain blockchain platform built on Substrate/Rust, to request a proposal for comprehensive security auditing services ahead of our mainnet launch in Q2 2026.

**Project Overview:**
- **Technology**: Substrate-based blockchain with custom consensus (BABE + GRANDPA + ASF)
- **Scope**: 50,000+ lines of Rust code, 15 custom pallets, cross-chain bridges
- **Timeline**: Audit in Q1 2026 (Jan-Mar)
- **Budget**: $50,000-100,000 per audit firm

We are seeking 2 independent audit firms with strong expertise in:
- Substrate/Rust blockchain security
- Consensus mechanism analysis (particularly GRANDPA/BABE)
- Smart contract security (WebAssembly)
- Cross-chain bridge security
- Cryptographic protocol review

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Core consensus mechanisms (including our novel ASF - Ascending Scale of Finality)
- Staking and economic incentive structures
- Governance system (Consensus Day voting)
- Cross-chain bridges (Ethereum, Base, BSC)
- Smart contract runtime (EtwasmVM)

Attached is our detailed Request for Proposal, which includes:
- Complete technical specifications
- Audit scope and deliverables
- Timeline and budget details
- Proposal requirements and evaluation criteria

**Proposal Deadline:** November 15, 2025

We would be honored to work with Trail of Bits given your exceptional reputation in blockchain security and your experience with Substrate-based systems. If you have any questions or would like additional information, please don't hesitate to reach out.

# START HERE - AI Monitoring Agent Deployment Package***NEEDTOUPDATE**

**Status:** Ready for Deployment
**Created:** 2025-11-01
**Target:** 15 Remaining Validator VMs
**Primary Server:** VM #10 (98.71.91.84)

## What You're Deploying

You now have a complete, production-ready deployment package for rolling out lightweight monitoring agents to 15 validator VMs. All agents will report to the central monitoring server on VM #10.

### Quick Facts
- **Duration:** 15-25 minutes deployment + 30-45 minutes verification
- **Risk:** Low (easily reversible, no impact on validators)
- **Prerequisites:** VM #10 operational, SSH key available
- **Cost:** $0 for agents, $56/month for Claude API on VM #10
- **Complexity:** Fully automated (single script)

## Deployment in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Verify VM #10 (5 minutes)
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/etrid_vm1 compiler-dev01@98.71.91.84 "systemctl status prometheus"
```
Should show "active (running)"

### Step 2: Run Deployment (20 minutes)
```bash
bash /Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid/deploy-monitoring-agents-parallel.sh
```

### Step 3: Verify Success (10 minutes)
```bash
cat /tmp/etrid-deployment-report.txt
curl http://98.71.91.84:9090/api/v1/targets | jq '.data.activeTargets | length'
```

Expected: 15 agents reporting

## Prerequisites Checklist

Before you start:
- [ ] VM #10 (98.71.91.84) is operational
- [ ] SSH key exists: `~/.ssh/etrid_vm1`
- [ ] SSH works: `ssh -i ~/.ssh/etrid_vm1 compiler-dev01@98.71.91.84 "echo OK"`
- [ ] Network connectivity to all 15 VMs
- [ ] ~1 hour available (including verification)

## What Gets Installed

**On Each of 15 VMs:**
- Node Exporter - System metrics collector
- Python Agent - Reports to VM #10
- Systemd Service - Auto-restart

**Impact per VM:**
- Disk: ~500 MB
- Memory: +100 MB
- CPU: <2%
- Cost: $0

## Success Indicators

You'll know it worked when:
✓ Script finishes with green checkmarks
✓ Deployment report: ≥13/15 "SUCCESS"
✓ Manual verification passes on sample VMs
✓ VM #10 receives metrics from agents
✓ Agents keep running for 30+ minutes

    <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All sensitive data, including your encrypted private keys and wallet information, is stored locally on your device. This data never leaves your device and is protected by your device's security features (PIN, biometrics, etc.).</p>

    <h2>Blockchain Data</h2>
    <p>When you make transactions, your wallet interacts directly with public blockchain networks. Blockchain transactions are public by nature and are not controlled by us.</p>

        <li>Blockchain RPC nodes (to broadcast transactions)</li>
        <li>DEX aggregators (for token swaps)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them.</p>

    <h2>Analytics</h2>
    <p>We may collect anonymous, aggregated usage statistics to improve our app. This data cannot be used to identify individual users and does not include any wallet or transaction information.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Local encryption of sensitive data</li>
        <li>Biometric authentication support</li>
        <li>No server-side storage of private keys</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app is not intended for users under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect information from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>

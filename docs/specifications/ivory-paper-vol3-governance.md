# PART I: LEGAL & ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE

## 1. ËTRID Foundation Charter

### 1.1 Legal Entity Structure

**Entity Type**: Delaware Non-Profit Corporation (or Swiss Stiftung equivalent)

**Incorporation Details**:
- **Name**: ËTRID Foundation
- **Jurisdiction**: Delaware, USA (or Zug, Switzerland)
- **Registration Date**: TBD (pending community vote)
- **Tax Status**: 501(c)(3) non-profit or equivalent

**Legal Structure**:
```
ËTRID Foundation (Delaware Non-Profit)
├── Board of Directors (9 Decentralized Directors)
│   ├── Technical Committee (3 members)
│   ├── Legal & Compliance Committee (2 members)
│   ├── Community Committee (2 members)
│   └── Security Committee (2 members)
├── Foundation Treasury (Multi-Sig 5-of-9)
├── Development Teams (Contractors)
└── Community (Voters, Validators, Stakers)
```

**Governance Model**: Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) with legal wrapper

**Key Principles**:
1. **Decentralization**: No single point of control
2. **Transparency**: All decisions public and on-chain
3. **Meritocracy**: Decisions based on expertise and contribution
4. **Inclusivity**: Open participation for all community members
5. **Sustainability**: Long-term viability over short-term gains

### 1.2 Mission & Vision

**Mission Statement**:
> "To build a decentralized, multi-chain blockchain infrastructure that empowers developers, users, and AI systems to transact freely, securely, and efficiently without centralized intermediaries."

**Core Values**:
- **Openness**: Open-source code (GPLv3), open governance
- **Security**: Prioritize security over features
- **Interoperability**: Bridge blockchains, not isolate them
- **Innovation**: Push boundaries of blockchain technology
- **Community**: Serve the community, not shareholders

**Long-Term Vision** (10-year roadmap):
- **2025-2026**: Launch mainnet, establish 13 PBC bridges
- **2027-2028**: Scale to 1M+ daily active users
- **2029-2030**: Integrate 50+ external blockchains
- **2031-2035**: Become top 10 blockchain by market cap and usage

### 1.3 Governance Principles

#### Principle 1: One Token, One Vote (Stake-Weighted)

Voting power is proportional to ÉTR staked, ensuring that those with long-term commitment have greater influence.

**Formula**:
```
Voting Power = Staked ÉTR × Coinage Multiplier

Where Coinage Multiplier:
- 0-6 months: 1.0x
- 6-12 months: 1.25x
- 12-18 months: 1.5x
- 18-24 months: 1.75x
- 24+ months: 2.0x (max)
```

**Example**:
```
Alice: 10,000 ÉTR staked for 24+ months
Voting Power = 10,000 × 2.0 = 20,000 votes

Bob: 20,000 ÉTR staked for 3 months
Voting Power = 20,000 × 1.0 = 20,000 votes

Result: Equal voting power despite different stake amounts
```

#### Principle 2: Checks and Balances

No single entity can unilaterally control the network.

**Multi-Signature Requirements**:
- **Treasury Spending** (< 10,000 ÉTR): 5-of-9 Directors
- **Treasury Spending** (> 10,000 ÉTR): 7-of-9 Directors + 3-day community veto period
- **Protocol Upgrades**: 7-of-9 Directors + 3-day community review
- **Emergency Actions**: 3-of-9 Directors (for urgent security fixes)

#### Principle 3: Transparency

All governance actions are public and auditable.

**Transparency Requirements**:
- All votes recorded on-chain
- All treasury transactions public
- Quarterly financial reports (ÉTR + USD value)
- Annual governance report
- Real-time dashboard: https://gov.etrid.org

#### Principle 4: Meritocracy

Leadership roles based on expertise and contribution, not wealth alone.

**Director Qualifications**:
- Minimum 6 months active community participation
- Demonstrated technical expertise OR community leadership
- No criminal record related to fraud or financial crimes
- Background check required (privacy-preserving)

# PART II: GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

## 2. Decentralized Directors

### 2.1 Board Structure

**Size**: 9 Directors (odd number to prevent ties)

**Election Cycle**: Annual (every Consensus Day)

**Term Length**: 1 year (renewable up to 3 consecutive terms)

**Rotation**: Minimum 3 directors rotated each year to ensure fresh perspectives

### 2.2 Election Process

#### Phase 1: Nomination (30 days before Consensus Day)

**Eligibility Criteria**:
- Active community member for minimum 6 months
- Minimum 1,000 ÉTR staked (to prevent spam candidates)
- No felony convictions related to fraud or financial crimes
- Must disclose conflicts of interest

**Self-Nomination**:
```
1. Submit nomination on-chain via governance pallet
2. Pay nomination deposit: 100 ÉTR (refunded if elected or receive >5% votes)
3. Submit candidate statement (max 500 words)
4. Optional: Submit campaign video (max 3 minutes)
```

**Nomination Review**:
- Technical Committee verifies eligibility
- Legal Committee performs background check
- Community discussion period (7 days)
- Candidates can be challenged (requires 1,000 ÉTR stake + valid reason)

#### Phase 2: Campaign (21 days before Consensus Day)

**Campaign Activities**:
- Public forums & AMAs (Ask Me Anything)
- Written statements published on governance portal
- Video presentations (optional)
- Community Discord/Telegram discussions

**Campaign Rules**:
- ❌ No vote buying (bribery)
- ❌ No coordinated attack campaigns
- ❌ No impersonation of other candidates
- ✅ Debate encouraged
- ✅ Critique of policies allowed

#### Phase 3: Voting (Consensus Day)

**Voting Method**: Ranked-Choice Voting (Instant Runoff)

**How It Works**:
```
1. Each voter ranks candidates in order of preference (1st, 2nd, 3rd, ...)
2. First-choice votes tallied
3. If no candidate has majority:
   a. Candidate with fewest votes eliminated
   b. Their votes redistributed to next choice
   c. Repeat until 9 directors elected
```

**Example**:
```
Round 1:
  Alice: 30% (3,000 votes)
  Bob: 25% (2,500 votes)
  Carol: 20% (2,000 votes)
  Dave: 15% (1,500 votes)
  Eve: 10% (1,000 votes) ← ELIMINATED

Round 2 (Eve's votes redistributed):
  Alice: 35% (3,500 votes)
  Bob: 30% (3,000 votes)
  Carol: 25% (2,500 votes)
  Dave: 10% (1,000 votes) ← ELIMINATED

... continue until 9 directors elected
```

**Voting Weight**:
```
Voting Power = Staked ÉTR × Coinage Multiplier × Voting Participation Bonus

Where Voting Participation Bonus:
- First-time voter: 1.0x
- Voted in 1 previous Consensus Day: 1.1x
- Voted in 2+ previous Consensus Days: 1.2x (max)
```

#### Phase 4: Results & Transition (Day after Consensus Day)

**Results Announcement**:
- Results published immediately on-chain
- 9 directors with most votes elected
- New directors take office January 1st (45-day transition period)

**Transition Process**:
```
Nov 15 (Consensus Day): Election held
Nov 16-Dec 31: Transition period
  - Outgoing directors brief incoming directors
  - Multi-sig keys transferred
  - Committee assignments finalized
Jan 1: New directors officially take office
```

### 2.4 Compensation & Incentives

#### Director Compensation

**Daily Distribution**: 5,479 ÉTR/day (20% of total)

**Allocation Per Director**: 5,479 / 9 = **608.78 ÉTR/day** ≈ **222,204 ÉTR/year**

**Vesting Schedule**:
```
- 50% paid immediately (monthly)
- 25% vested over 6 months
- 25% vested over 12 months
```

**Why Vesting?**
- Encourages long-term commitment
- Prevents "pump and dump" behavior
- Aligns director incentives with network success

**Example (Annual)**:
```
Total Compensation: 222,204 ÉTR

Month 1-12: 111,102 ÉTR paid immediately (50%)
Month 7-12: 55,551 ÉTR vested (25%)
Month 13-24: 55,551 ÉTR vested (25%)

Total Vested by Month 24: 222,204 ÉTR
```

#### Performance Incentives

**Bonus Pool**: 10% of director allocation (547.9 ÉTR/day)

**Performance Metrics**:
1. **Attendance**: Full compensation requires 90%+ meeting attendance
2. **Deliverables**: Complete assigned tasks on time
3. **Community Satisfaction**: Quarterly community rating (1-5 stars)

**Bonus Calculation**:
```
Bonus = Base Bonus × (Attendance % / 90%) × (Community Rating / 5.0)

Example:
- Base Bonus: 54.79 ÉTR/day
- Attendance: 95% (100% bonus multiplier)
- Community Rating: 4.5/5.0 (90% multiplier)

Actual Bonus = 54.79 × 1.0 × 0.9 = 49.31 ÉTR/day
```

#### Penalties

**Missed Meetings**:
- Each missed meeting: -2% daily compensation
- More than 10% missed meetings: Removal vote triggered

**Poor Performance**:
- Community rating < 3.0 stars for 2 consecutive quarters: Removal vote

**Conflicts of Interest**:
- Undisclosed conflict: -50% compensation + potential removal
- Bribery/corruption: Immediate removal + legal action

#### Phase Detection (On-Chain Implementation)

The current governance phase is determined automatically by the calendar date:

```swift
/// Determines the current Consensus Day phase based on calendar date
public static func currentPhase(for date: Date = Date()) -> ConsensusDayPhase {
    let calendar = Calendar.current
    let month = calendar.component(.month, from: date)
    let day = calendar.component(.day, from: date)

    switch month {
    case 12: // December
        switch day {
        case 1:
            return .voting      // Consensus Day
        case 2...30:
            return .execution   // Implementation period
        case 31:
            return .distribution // Year-end distribution
        default:
            return .inactive
        }
    default: // January through November
        return .registration    // Proposals accepted
    }
}
```

#### Phase Properties

| Phase | Dates | Duration | Proposals Accepted | Voting Active |
|-------|-------|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Registration** | Jan 1 - Nov 30 | 334 days | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Voting** | Dec 1 | 24 hours | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Execution** | Dec 2-30 | 29 days | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Distribution** | Dec 31 | 24 hours | ❌ No | ❌ No |

**Why December 1st for Consensus Day?**
- Fixed, memorable date (same day every year)
- Aligns with fiscal year planning (before January 1st start)

## 4. Distribution Pay Economics

### 4.1 FODDOS Hybrid Economic Model

The Distribution Pay System implements the **FODDOS (Foundation-Owned Decentralized DAO Operating System)** hybrid economic model, combining two revenue streams:

1. **Year-Round Fee Collection**: VMw transaction fees accumulate in Treasury
2. **Annual Consensus Day Distribution**: Accumulated fees + new minting distributed to participants

**Fee Collection Flow:**
```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                        YEAR-ROUND FEE COLLECTION                             ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Contract Execution → VMw Gas → Convert to ÉTR Fee → Withdraw from Caller
                                                          ↓

                                      (accumulates)           (deflationary)
```

**Fee Sources:**
| Source | Treasury Share | Burn Share | Purpose |
|--------|---------------|------------|---------|
| VMw Transaction Fees | 50% | 50% | Contract execution |
| Cross-Chain Bridge Fees | 10% | 0% | Bridge operations |
| EDSC Stability Fees | 100% | 0% | Stablecoin interest |
| Validator Slashing | 50% | 50% | Security penalties |

### 4.2 Consensus Day Distribution (December 1st)

**Accumulated Treasury Fees Distribution:**
```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗

```

**Participant Distribution (40% of accumulated fees):**

| Recipient | Share of 40% | Effective Share | Purpose |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| Foundation | 40% | 16% of fees | Long-term development, security |
| Directors (9) | 20% | 8% of fees | Governance leadership |
| Validators | 25% | 10% of fees | Network security incentives |
| Voters | 15% | 6% of fees | Participation rewards |

**Development Fund (60% of accumulated fees):**
- Remains in Treasury for governance-approved spending
- Requires 5-of-9 (< 10,000 ÉTR) or 7-of-9 (> 10,000 ÉTR) director approval
- Budget categories: Development (40%), Marketing (20%), Operations (15%), Grants (15%), Emergency (10%)

### 4.3 Minting-Based Distribution (Legacy + New Tokens)

In addition to fee-based distribution, 1% of newly minted tokens are distributed:

**Total Daily Minting Pool**: 27,397 ÉTR (10M ÉTR/year ÷ 365 days)

**Distribution Times (UTC)**:

| Time | Category | Amount (ÉTR) | Recipients | Purpose |
|------|----------|--------------|------------|---------|
| 00:01 | Voters | 2,740 | ~1,000 | Consensus Day participation |
| 04:01 | Primearc Validators | 4,110 | 21 | Core chain validation |
| 06:01 | Validity Nodes | 4,109 | 104 | PBC collation |
| 08:01 | Stakers | 10,959 | Variable | Long-term holders |
| 12:01 | Directors | 5,479 | 9 | Governance leadership |

**Total**: 27,397 ÉTR/day from minting

### 4.4 Combined Rewards Example

A participant receives rewards from BOTH fee-based distribution AND minting pool:

**Example: Active Voter with 10,000 ÉTR Staked**
```
Assume: 100,000 ÉTR in accumulated treasury fees

Fee-Based Distribution (40% of 100,000 = 40,000 ÉTR to participants):
- Voters pool: 15% of 40,000 = 6,000 ÉTR
- Your share (0.1% of voters pool): 6 ÉTR

Minting-Based Distribution (2,740 ÉTR/day to voters):
- Your share (0.1%): 2.74 ÉTR/day

Total Annual Reward: 6 ÉTR (fees) + 1,000 ÉTR (minting) = 1,006 ÉTR
```

### 4.5 Allocation Breakdown (Minting Pool)

#### 40% Foundation Treasury (10,959 ÉTR/day)

**Purpose**: Fund development, security audits, marketing, legal, operations

**Breakdown**:
```
Development (50%):     5,479 ÉTR/day = 2M ÉTR/year
Security (20%):        2,192 ÉTR/day = 800K ÉTR/year
Marketing (15%):       1,644 ÉTR/day = 600K ÉTR/year
Legal (10%):           1,096 ÉTR/day = 400K ÉTR/year
Operations (5%):       548 ÉTR/day = 200K ÉTR/year
```

**Spending Approval**:
- < 1,000 ÉTR: Technical Committee approval (3 members)
- 1,000-10,000 ÉTR: 5-of-9 Directors
- > 10,000 ÉTR: 7-of-9 Directors + 3-day community veto period

#### 30% Validators (8,219 ÉTR/day)

**Primearc Validators (15%)**: 4,110 ÉTR/day ÷ 21 validators = **195.71 ÉTR/day per validator**

**Validity Nodes (15%)**: 4,109 ÉTR/day ÷ 104 collators = **39.51 ÉTR/day per collator**

**Why Different Amounts?**
- Primearc Validators secure entire core chain (higher responsibility)
- Validity Nodes collate individual PBCs (lower responsibility)
- Ratio: ~5:1 (Primearc:Validity)

**Annual Validator Rewards**:
```
Primearc Validator: 195.71 ÉTR/day × 365 = 71,434 ÉTR/year
Validity Node: 39.51 ÉTR/day × 365 = 14,421 ÉTR/year
```

#### 20% Decentralized Directors (5,479 ÉTR/day)

**Per Director**: 5,479 ÉTR ÷ 9 = **608.78 ÉTR/day** = **222,204 ÉTR/year**

**Vesting**:
- 50% immediate: 304.39 ÉTR/day
- 25% 6-month vest: 152.20 ÉTR/day
- 25% 12-month vest: 152.20 ÉTR/day

#### 10% Voters (2,740 ÉTR/day)

**Eligibility**: Participated in Consensus Day voting

**Distribution Method**: Pro-rata based on voting power used

**Example** (1,000 voters with avg 10,000 ÉTR stake):
```
Total Voting Power: 1,000 voters × 10,000 ÉTR = 10M votes
Your Stake: 10,000 ÉTR
Your Share: 10,000 / 10,000,000 = 0.1%
Your Reward: 2,740 ÉTR × 0.1% = 2.74 ÉTR/day

Annual: 2.74 ÉTR/day × 365 = 1,000 ÉTR/year
```

**Minimum Participation**: Must vote on at least 1 proposal to qualify

### 4.3 Coinage Multiplier System

**Formula**:
```
Reward = Base Reward × Coinage Multiplier

Where Coinage Multiplier depends on stake duration:
- 0-6 months:    1.0x
- 6-12 months:   1.25x
- 12-18 months:  1.5x
- 18-24 months:  1.75x
- 24+ months:    2.0x (maximum)
```

**Implementation**:
```rust
pub fn calculate_coinage_multiplier(stake_duration_days: u64) -> u32 {
    // Returns basis points (10000 = 1.0x)
    match stake_duration_days {
        0..=180 => 10000,         // 1.0x
        181..=365 => 12500,       // 1.25x
        366..=545 => 15000,       // 1.5x
        546..=730 => 17500,       // 1.75x
        _ => 20000,               // 2.0x (730+ days)
    }
}
```

**Examples**:

| Stake Duration | Base Reward | Multiplier | Final Reward |
|----------------|-------------|------------|--------------|
| 3 months (90d) | 100 ÉTR | 1.0x | **100 ÉTR** |
| 9 months (270d) | 100 ÉTR | 1.25x | **125 ÉTR** |
| 15 months (450d) | 100 ÉTR | 1.5x | **150 ÉTR** |
| 21 months (630d) | 100 ÉTR | 1.75x | **175 ÉTR** |
| 30 months (900d) | 100 ÉTR | 2.0x | **200 ÉTR** |

**Why Coinage Multiplier?**
- Rewards long-term commitment
- Reduces circulating supply (more staking = less selling)
- Increases network security
- Discourages short-term speculation

### 4.4 Penalty & Reward Mechanisms

#### Validator Penalties

**Missed Block**:
- Penalty: 0.1% of daily reward per missed block
- Max Penalty: 10% of daily reward (100 missed blocks)
- Recovery: No missed blocks for 24 hours resets counter

**Double-Sign** (Equivocation):
- Penalty: 10% of total stake (slashing)
- Immediate removal from validator set
- Ban duration: 90 days

**Offline** (No blocks produced for 1 hour):
- Penalty: 0.01% per hour offline
- Grace period: 1 hour (system maintenance)
- Max Penalty: 5% of daily reward

**Example**:
```
Primearc Validator Daily Reward: 195.71 ÉTR

Scenario 1: Missed 10 blocks
Penalty: 195.71 × 0.1% × 10 = 1.96 ÉTR
Final Reward: 195.71 - 1.96 = 193.75 ÉTR

Scenario 2: Offline for 6 hours
Penalty: 195.71 × 0.01% × 6 = 0.12 ÉTR
Final Reward: 195.71 - 0.12 = 195.59 ÉTR

Scenario 3: Double-sign
Penalty: Total stake slashed by 10%
Final Reward: 0 ÉTR + removed from validator set
```

#### Director Penalties

**Missed Meeting**:
- Penalty: 2% of daily compensation
- 3 consecutive missed meetings: Warning issued
- 5 missed meetings in a quarter: Removal vote triggered

**Low Community Rating**:
- Rating < 3.0 stars for 1 quarter: -10% compensation
- Rating < 3.0 stars for 2 consecutive quarters: Removal vote
- Rating > 4.5 stars: +5% bonus

**Conflict of Interest**:
- Undisclosed conflict: -50% compensation + formal reprimand
- Material conflict (financial gain): Immediate removal
- Bribery/corruption: Removal + legal action + blacklist

## 5. Treasury Management

### 5.1 Foundation Treasury

The Treasury receives funds from multiple sources and distributes them according to the FODDOS hybrid model:

**Funding Sources:**
```

│  Consensus Day Minting    ────────────────────────────────→ 100% to Treasury │
│  (approved budget allocations)                                               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Daily Allocation** (from minting): 10,959 ÉTR (40% of 27,397 ÉTR)
**Year-Round Accumulation**: Variable (depends on network activity)
**Annual Budget**: 4M ÉTR/year (minting) + accumulated fees

**Multi-Signature Wallet**:
- **Address**: `5FKgJ...` (Ëtrid multi-sig)
- **Signers**: 9 Decentralized Directors
- **Threshold**: 5-of-9 (standard), 7-of-9 (large expenditures)
- **Pallet ID**: `py/trsry`

**Budget Categories (for 60% Development Fund):**
```
Development (40%):        Infrastructure, security, research
Marketing (20%):          Community growth, partnerships, outreach
Operations (15%):         Team salaries, legal, administrative
Grants (15%):             Ecosystem grants, bounties, developer support
Emergency Reserve (10%):  Locked for critical situations only
```

### 5.2 Consensus Day Treasury Distribution

During Consensus Day (December 1st), accumulated transaction fees are distributed:

**Fee Distribution Mechanism:**
```rust
// Treasury Query Interface (used by pallet-consensus-day)
pub trait TreasuryQueryInterface<Balance> {
    fn get_transaction_fee_balance() -> Balance;
    fn withdraw_for_distribution(amount: Balance) -> DispatchResult;
}

// Distribution split
let accumulated_fees = Treasury::get_transaction_fee_balance();
let participant_pool = accumulated_fees * 40 / 100;  // 40% to participants
let development_fund = accumulated_fees * 60 / 100;  // 60% stays in treasury

// Participant distribution
let foundation_share = participant_pool * 40 / 100;   // 16% of total
let directors_share = participant_pool * 20 / 100;    // 8% of total
let validators_share = participant_pool * 25 / 100;   // 10% of total
let voters_share = participant_pool * 15 / 100;       // 6% of total
```

**Note**: This distribution happens automatically during the Distribution phase of Consensus Day and does NOT require director approval. It is part of the protocol-level economic mechanism.

#### Phase 3: Governance Vote

**Duration**: 7 days

**Voting Method**: On-chain governance vote

**Approval Threshold**:
- **Standard Upgrades** (features, optimizations): 60% approval
- **Critical Upgrades** (consensus changes, economic model): 70% approval
- **Constitutional Upgrades** (governance changes): 80% approval (supermajority)

**Quorum**:
- Standard: 20% of staked ÉTR

- Provide migration guide for affected users
- Deploy via on-chain runtime upgrade
- Monitor for 48 hours post-upgrade

### 6.2 Runtime Upgrade Mechanics

#### Ëtrid Runtime Upgrades

**How It Works**:
```
1. Compile new runtime (WASM blob)
2. Submit via governance extrinsic:
   system.setCode(new_runtime_blob)
3. 7-of-9 Directors approve (multi-sig)
4. Runtime upgrade enacted on next block
5. All nodes automatically use new runtime (no hard fork!)
```

**Example**:
```rust
// Submit runtime upgrade
pub fn propose_runtime_upgrade(
    origin: OriginFor<T>,
    new_runtime: Vec<u8>,
) -> DispatchResult {
    // Verify origin (must be Technical Committee or Directors)
    T::EnsureRootOrTwoThirds::ensure_origin(origin)?;

    // Validate runtime
    ensure!(new_runtime.len() < MAX_RUNTIME_SIZE, Error::<T>::RuntimeTooLarge);

    // Schedule upgrade
    frame_system::Pallet::<T>::set_code_without_checks(
        RawOrigin::Root.into(),
        new_runtime,
    )?;

    Ok(())
}
```

**Benefits**:
- No hard fork required
- No node downtime
- Seamless upgrades
- Coordinated activation

### 6.3 Emergency Upgrades

**Trigger Conditions**:
- Critical security vulnerability discovered
- Network halt or significant performance degradation
- Exploits actively being used

**Fast-Track Process**:
```
1. Security Committee identifies critical issue (within 1 hour)
2. Emergency patch developed (within 24 hours)
3. 3-of-9 Directors approve (within 4 hours)
4. Deploy to testnet (within 2 hours)
5. If stable, deploy to mainnet immediately
```

**Post-Mortem**:
- Publish detailed incident report within 7 days
- Community AMA to address concerns
- Retroactive community vote to ratify emergency upgrade (60% approval)
- If community rejects (< 60%), revert upgrade and find alternative solution

## 7. Emergency Procedures

### 7.1 Emergency Fund Access

**Purpose**: Respond to critical security incidents, legal threats, or disasters

**Fund Size**: 10% of treasury reserves (400K ÉTR)

**Access Triggers**:
1. **Security Breach**: Active exploit of critical vulnerability
2. **Legal Threat**: Lawsuit, regulatory action requiring immediate legal response
3. **Natural Disaster**: Affects core team or infrastructure
4. **Economic Crisis**: Extreme market volatility threatening network stability

**Approval Process**:

**Tier 1: Immediate (< 10,000 ÉTR)**
- Approver: Any 3 Directors (emergency multi-sig)
- Timeframe: 1 hour
- No community vote required (but post-incident report mandatory)

**Tier 2: Urgent (10,000-50,000 ÉTR)**
- Approver: 5-of-9 Directors
- Timeframe: 6 hours
- Community notification required (within 24 hours)

**Tier 3: Critical (> 50,000 ÉTR)**
- Approver: 7-of-9 Directors
- Timeframe: 24 hours
- Community vote retroactive (within 7 days, 60% approval to ratify)

### 7.2 Circuit Breaker Activation

#### Purpose
Temporarily halt certain network functions to prevent catastrophic losses.

#### Trigger Conditions

**Bridge Circuit Breaker**:
- Daily withdrawal limit exceeded (e.g., > $10M/day for BTC bridge)
- Suspicious large withdrawals (e.g., 100 withdrawals of exactly 1 BTC within 1 hour)
- Oracle price manipulation detected (> 20% deviation from baseline)
- Custodian private key compromise suspected

**Trading Circuit Breaker** (DEX/AMM):
- Flash crash (> 30% price drop in 5 minutes)
- Unusually high volume (> 10x daily average within 1 hour)
- Oracle manipulation detected

**Governance Circuit Breaker**:
- Suspicious voting patterns (e.g., single entity controlling > 40% of votes)
- Last-minute vote swings (> 20% change in final hour)
- Potential bribery detected

#### Activation Process

**Automatic Triggers** (Smart contract enforced):
```rust
impl CircuitBreaker {
    pub fn check_and_trigger(&mut self, current_metrics: &Metrics) -> Result<(), BreakerError> {
        // Check daily withdrawal limit
        if current_metrics.daily_withdrawn > self.daily_limit {
            self.trigger("Daily withdrawal limit exceeded");
            return Err(BreakerError::LimitExceeded);
        }

        // Check oracle deviation
        if current_metrics.price_deviation > Permill::from_percent(20) {
            self.trigger("Oracle price deviation detected");
            return Err(BreakerError::PriceManipulation);
        }

        Ok(())
    }

    fn trigger(&mut self, reason: &str) {
        self.paused = true;
        self.reason = Some(reason.as_bytes().to_vec());
        self.paused_at = Some(current_timestamp());

        // Emit emergency event
        emit_event(Event::CircuitBreakerTriggered {
            reason: reason.into(),
            timestamp: current_timestamp(),
        });

        // Notify Directors (off-chain)
        notify_directors_emergency(reason);
    }
}
```

**Manual Triggers** (Governance):
- Any 3 Directors can manually trigger circuit breaker
- Must provide justification (on-chain)
- Community notified immediately

#### Resolution Process

**Phase 1: Investigation (0-6 hours)**
- Security Committee investigates root cause
- Assess damage and determine fix

**Phase 2: Fix Development (6-24 hours)**
- Develop patch or mitigation
- Test on isolated testnet
- Prepare communication to community

**Phase 3: Community Discussion (24-48 hours)**
- Publish incident report
- Explain proposed fix
- Community feedback period

**Phase 4: Resolution (48-72 hours)**
- Deploy fix (if approved by 7-of-9 Directors)
- Resume normal operations
- Post-mortem report published

### 7.3 Security Incident Response

#### Incident Severity Levels

**Critical (P0)**:
- Active exploit draining funds
- Network completely halted
- Private keys compromised
- **Response Time**: < 1 hour

**High (P1)**:
- Vulnerability actively being exploited
- Significant performance degradation

- Assess scope of impact
- Determine if user funds at risk
```

**Step 4: Communication**
```
- Notify community (Twitter, Discord, governance forum)
- Provide status updates every 2 hours (P0), 6 hours (P1)
- Be transparent about risks
```

**Step 5: Remediation**
```
- Develop fix
- Test thoroughly
- Deploy via emergency upgrade process
```

**Step 6: Recovery**
```
- Resume normal operations
- Monitor for 48 hours
- Compensate affected users (if applicable)
```

**Step 7: Post-Mortem**
```
- Publish detailed incident report within 7 days
- Community AMA
- Implement preventive measures
```

#### Bug Bounty Program

**Tiers**:

| Severity | Reward | Examples |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **Critical** | 50,000-500,000 ÉTR | Remote code execution, consensus failure, bridge fund drain |
| **High** | 5,000-50,000 ÉTR | Significant security vulnerability, data leak |
| **Medium** | 1,000-5,000 ÉTR | Non-critical security issue |
| **Low** | 100-1,000 ÉTR | Typos, documentation errors |

**Bridge-Specific Bounties**:
- **Critical Bridge Bug**: Up to $1,000,000 (paid in USDC/USDT)
- **Rationale**: Bridges hold significant TVL; critical bugs could drain millions

**Submission Process**:
```
1. Report vulnerability privately to gizzi_io@proton.me
2. Include detailed steps to reproduce
3. Wait 48 hours for acknowledgment
4. Security Committee verifies and assigns severity
5. Payment sent within 7 days of verification
```

**Responsible Disclosure**:
- ✅ Report privately first (30-90 day embargo)
- ✅ Allow time for patch development
- ✅ Coordinate public disclosure
- ❌ Do NOT publicly disclose before patch
- ❌ Do NOT exploit vulnerability for personal gain

## 8. Voter Participation

### 8.1 Eligibility Requirements

**Minimum Requirements**:
- Own at least 1 ÉTR (no minimum stake required for basic voting)
- Identity verification (for Sybil resistance)
- Active account (at least 1 transaction in past 365 days)

**Identity Verification Methods**:
1. **On-Chain** (recommended):
   - Link Ethereum address with ENS name
   - Link Polkadot address with on-chain identity
   - Use decentralized identity protocols (did:etrd, did:web)

2. **Off-Chain** (optional):
   - KYC via third-party service (for enhanced voting weight)
   - Social verification (Twitter, GitHub, LinkedIn)

**Sybil Resistance**:
- Each identity can create multiple accounts, but voting power is combined
- Prevents vote splitting attack (creating 1,000 accounts with 1 ÉTR each)

### 8.2 Stake-Weighted Voting

**Formula**:
```
Voting Power = Base Stake × Coinage Multiplier × Participation Bonus

Where:
- Base Stake = Amount of ÉTR staked
- Coinage Multiplier = 1.0x to 2.0x (based on stake duration)
- Participation Bonus = 1.0x to 1.2x (based on voting history)
```

**Example**:
```
Alice:
  Base Stake: 10,000 ÉTR
  Stake Duration: 25 months (2.0x multiplier)
  Participation: Voted in 3 previous Consensus Days (1.2x bonus)

Voting Power = 10,000 × 2.0 × 1.2 = 24,000 votes

Bob:
  Base Stake: 20,000 ÉTR
  Stake Duration: 2 months (1.0x multiplier)
  Participation: First-time voter (1.0x bonus)

Voting Power = 20,000 × 1.0 × 1.0 = 20,000 votes

Result: Alice has more voting power despite lower stake
```

**Why Stake-Weighted?**
- Aligns voting power with economic stake
- Encourages long-term commitment
- Reduces influence of short-term speculators
- Rewards active community participation

### 8.3 Voter Rewards

**Daily Allocation**: 2,740 ÉTR (10% of total daily distribution)

**Distribution Method**: Pro-rata based on votes cast

**Calculation**:
```
Your Reward = (Your Votes / Total Votes) × 2,740 ÉTR

Example:
  Total Votes Cast: 10,000,000
  Your Votes: 10,000
  Your Share: 10,000 / 10,000,000 = 0.1%
  Your Reward: 0.1% × 2,740 ÉTR = 2.74 ÉTR

Annualized: 2.74 ÉTR/day × 365 = 1,000 ÉTR/year
```

**Eligibility**:
- Must vote on at least 1 proposal during Consensus Day
- Rewards distributed proportionally to all voters
- If you vote on more proposals, you don't get extra rewards (rewards are per-account, not per-vote)

**Distribution Timeline**:
- Rewards calculated immediately after Consensus Day (Nov 15)
- Distribution begins Nov 16 at 00:01 UTC
- Daily distribution continues for 365 days until next Consensus Day

### 8.4 Delegation Mechanisms

**Purpose**: Allow stakers to delegate voting power to trusted experts without unstaking

**How It Works**:
```rust
pub fn delegate_votes(
    origin: OriginFor<T>,
    delegate: T::AccountId,
) -> DispatchResult {
    let delegator = ensure_signed(origin)?;

    // Record delegation
    VoteDelegation::<T>::insert(&delegator, &delegate);

    // Delegator keeps custody of tokens (no transfer)
    // Delegate can vote on behalf of delegator

    Ok(())
}
```

**Benefits**:
- **For Delegators**: Participate in governance without deep technical knowledge
- **For Delegates**: Build reputation as trusted community leader
- **For Network**: Higher participation rates, better-informed decisions

**Example**:
```
Alice has 100,000 ÉTR but doesn't have time to evaluate proposals.
Bob is a blockchain expert and active community member.

Alice delegates voting power to Bob.
Bob can now vote with:
  - His own 10,000 ÉTR
  - Alice's delegated 100,000 ÉTR
  - Total: 110,000 voting power

Alice can revoke delegation at any time.
```

**Delegation Limits**:
- Can only delegate to 1 person at a time
- Can revoke delegation at any time (takes effect immediately)
- Delegate cannot transfer delegated voting power
- Delegation does not transfer custody of tokens

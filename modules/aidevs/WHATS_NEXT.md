# Register DIDs
cd /Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid/ai-devs/scripts
npm install
node register_dids.js
```

**Verify:**
```bash
node resolve_did.js --all
# Should show all 15 DIDs registered
```

---

### 2. Deploy DID Resolver API (30 minutes)
**What:** Launch REST API for DID resolution

**Local Deployment:**
```bash
cd /Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid/ai-devs/api

### 3. Web Interface Integration (1 hour)
**What:** Deploy DID Registry + AI Devs Dashboard

**Steps:**
```bash
# Copy components to Next.js app
cp web/DIDRegistryPage.tsx apps/wallet-web/etrid-crypto-website/app/dids/page.tsx
cp web/AIDevsDashboard.tsx apps/wallet-web/etrid-crypto-website/app/ai-devs/page.tsx

# Update API URL in components
# Edit: apps/wallet-web/etrid-crypto-website/.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_DID_API_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Test locally
cd apps/wallet-web/etrid-crypto-website
npm run dev
# Visit: http://localhost:3000/dids

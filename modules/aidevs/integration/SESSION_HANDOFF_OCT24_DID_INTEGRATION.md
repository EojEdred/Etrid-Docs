# Session Handoff - AI Devs DID Integration (Oct 24, 2025)

**Session Focus:** Infrastructure Planning + AI Devs Digital Footprint Blueprint
**Duration:** 1 hour
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for DID Integration

---

## 🎯 What We Completed This Session

### 1. VectorDB Issue Resolution ✅
- **Problem:** Pydantic validation errors between qdrant-client and Qdrant server
- **Attempted Fix:** Upgraded qdrant-client from 1.7.0 to >=1.12.0
- **Result:** Error persists, accepted as non-critical limitation
- **Impact:** System operates with graceful degradation (skills work without VectorDB)
- **Status:** RESOLVED - Documented as known limitation, deferred to production

### 2. Infrastructure Deployment Plan Created ✅
**File:** `/Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid/ai-devs/INFRASTRUCTURE_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md` (14,000+ lines)

**Key Highlights:**
- **3 Validators:** 8-core @ 3.4GHz, 64GB RAM, 2TB NVMe (~$360/month)
- **13 Collators:** One per E³20 component, 4-core, 16-32GB RAM (~$396/month)
- **1 Archive Node:** Full historical data for block explorer (~$87/month)
- **Monitoring Stack:** Prometheus + Grafana (~$7/month)
- **Total Cost:** $822/month (Hetzner), $1,081/month (OVH), or $911/month (Hybrid)

**VPS Provider Comparison:**
- **Hetzner (Recommended):** Best price/performance, unlimited traffic, blockchain-friendly
- **OVHcloud:** Higher performance, more expensive, good for redundancy
- **Cherry Servers:** Blockchain-optimized bare metal (requires quote)
- **OnFinality:** Substrate-specialized (requires quote)

**7-Week Deployment Timeline:**
- Weeks 1-2: Server provisioning and OS setup
- Weeks 3-4: Node deployment (validators + collators)
- Weeks 5-6: Testing, optimization, block explorer
- Week 7: Public launch (Q1 2026)

**Budget Approved:** Awaiting stakeholder approval for $822/month

## 🚀 What to Start Next Session

### Priority 1: AI Devs DID Integration (HIGH)
**Goal:** Give AI Devs on-chain identities + digital presence

**Start Here:**
1. **Create DID Documents** (`/ai-devs/dids/` folder)
   - Generate DID documents for all 12 AI Devs
   - Generate DID documents for 3 Gizzi personas
   - Include: id, controller, publicKey, service endpoints, metadata

2. **Generate Keypairs**
   - Ed25519 keypairs for each AI Dev
   - Store public keys in DID documents
   - Secure private keys (encrypted, offline backup)

3. **Create CLAUDE_SKILLS/ Directory**
   - Extract skills from Claude packet into JSON skill cards
   - Create schema for skill cards (name, description, available_to, parameters)
   - Add 8+ skills: Risk Analysis, Code Review, Security Audit, Economic Modeling, etc.

4. **Create GLOBAL_MEMORY.md**
   - Shared memory file for cross-peer communication
   - Add memory protocol (timestamp, dev_id, event, action, status)
   - Initialize with example entries

5. **Add mcp_config.yaml to AI Dev Packs**
   - Create template with connectors (claude, gizzi, vectordb)
   - Add to all 12 AI Dev packs
   - Configure skill/memory paths

**Reference File:** `/Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid/ai-devs/NEXT_SESSION_AI_DEVS_DID_INTEGRATION.md`

### Priority 2: Infrastructure Deployment (MEDIUM)
**Goal:** Deploy Ember testnet infrastructure

**Blocked By:** Budget approval ($822/month)

**When Approved:**
1. Create Hetzner account
2. Order servers (3 validators, 13 collators, 1 archive, 1 monitoring)
3. Register domain names (etrid.org, explorer.etrid.org, api.etrid.org)
4. Begin Phase 1 (server provisioning)

**Reference File:** `/Users/macbook/Desktop/etrid/ai-devs/INFRASTRUCTURE_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md`

### Priority 3: Component Documentation Updates (LOW)
**Goal:** Update 13 README files to reference "Ember testnet"

**Files to Update:**
- All component READMEs in `/xx-component-name/`
- Replace references to "testnet" with "Ember testnet"
- Add Ember launch timeline (Q1 2026)
- Link to infrastructure plan

## 🎓 Key Concepts for Next Session

### AI DID (Decentralized Identifier)
- Each AI Dev gets a unique DID (e.g., `did:etrid:consensus-dev01`)
- DID documents stored on-chain via OpenDID pallet
- DID resolves to: identity, public key, service endpoints, metadata
- Enables cryptographic verification of AI Dev actions

### DID Document Structure
```json
{
  "id": "did:etrid:consensus-dev01",
  "controller": "did:etrid:gizzi",
  "publicKey": [{
    "id": "consensus-key-1",
    "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",
    "publicKeyBase58": "..."
  }],
  "service": [{
    "id": "consensus-service",
    "type": "AIConsensusWorker",
    "serviceEndpoint": "p2p://consensus-dev"
  }],
  "metadata": {
    "twitter": "@EtridAI_Devs",
    "memory_log": "MEMORY.md",
    "skill_ref": "SKILL.md"
  }
}
```

### Shared Knowledge Layer
- **CLAUDE_SKILLS/**: JSON skill cards available to multiple devs
- **GLOBAL_MEMORY.md**: Shared memory for cross-peer communication
- **mcp_config.yaml**: Orchestration hooks for MCP routing

### Digital Footprint
- **Twitter:** @EtridAI_Devs (consolidated account, all 12 devs post in their voice)
- **Gizzi Personas:**
  - Gizzi → Main strategist/narrator
  - GizziClaude → Deep reasoning dev node
  - GizziClaudeCode → Rust/Substrate builder voice
- **Content:** Dev logs, memory updates, cross-dev conversations (public)

---

## 🔧 Technical Context

### OpenDID Pallet
**Location:** `/pallets/pallet-did-registry/src/lib.rs`

**Key Functions:**
- `register_did()` - Register new DID on-chain
- `update_did()` - Update DID document
- `resolve_did()` - Query DID document
- `revoke_did()` - Revoke DID (emergency)

**Storage:**
- `DIDs<T>` - Map of DID → DID Document
- `Controllers<T>` - Map of DID → Controller DID

**May Need to Extend:**
- Add AI Dev metadata fields (dev_type, skill_ref, memory_ref, service_endpoint)
- Add social media fields (twitter_handle, github_repo)

### MCP Orchestration
**Current Setup:**
- FastAPI orchestrator at `/ai-devs/orchestrator/server.py`
- 6 agents with skill execution via POST `/execute`
- Skills loaded from `/ai-devs/orchestrator/skills/`

**To Add:**
- MCP routing to CLAUDE_SKILLS/
- GLOBAL_MEMORY.md sync (every 5 minutes)
- Audit trail logging to `/logs/`
- Cross-peer communication protocol

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### VectorDB Status
- ⚠️ **Known Issue:** qdrant-client/Qdrant server version mismatch
- **Impact:** Execution history not stored persistently
- **Workaround:** System operates with graceful degradation
- **Priority:** LOW - Deferred to production deployment
- **Do Not Spend Time On:** Issue is accepted, move forward with DID integration

### Budget Status
- 💰 **Infrastructure Plan:** $822/month (Hetzner)
- **Status:** Awaiting stakeholder approval
- **Action:** Do not order servers until budget approved
- **Alternative:** Continue with AI Devs DID work (no budget required)

### Time Estimate
- **DID Integration:** 6 hours across 3 sessions
- **Session 1 (2 hours):** DID docs, keypairs, CLAUDE_SKILLS/, GLOBAL_MEMORY.md, Twitter
- **Session 2 (2 hours):** OpenDID extension, on-chain registration, DID resolver API
- **Session 3 (2 hours):** Web interface, testing, documentation

## 📞 Questions to Clarify Next Session

1. **Twitter Strategy Confirmation:**
   - Proceed with Option A (consolidated @EtridAI_Devs account)?
   - Or reserve individual handles now for future expansion?

2. **DID Keypair Storage:**
   - Where should private keys be stored? (encrypted file, hardware wallet, KMS?)
   - Who should have access? (Eoj only, or multiple admins?)

3. **On-Chain Registration:**
   - Which chain to register DIDs on? (Primearc Core Chain testnet, dev chain, or wait for Ember?)
   - Should we deploy a local dev chain for testing first?

4. **Web Interface Priority:**
   - Should we build DID Registry web page in Session 2 or defer to Session 3?
   - Deploy to Vercel or separate infrastructure?
